#### Business Problem
###################################################

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-purchase ratings for products. The solution to this problem means greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, better visibility for sellers' products, and a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is the proper sorting of product reviews. Misleading reviews can directly impact the sale of a product, resulting in both financial loss and customer loss. By solving these two fundamental problems, e-commerce sites and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can complete their purchasing journey seamlessly.
